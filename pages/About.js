With my background in the art industry and experience in many fields of body expression (everything between dancing-acting-directing-and-teaching), I can bring a unique perspective to the world of web development. I have a passion for user experience and design principles, which evoke the desired outcome. In the end I believe that emotions are the motivator of userâ€™s engagement. Thatâ€™s where coding stands for me, as a interdisciplinary space of translation. And I love the process of building something from scratch and figuring out the best solutions to challenges along the way. There's nothing quite like the feeling of watching an idea come to life. I deeply value effective communication and co-creation of healthy and motivating working environment ~ I â€˜m a team player. Also, I'm a certified Reiki Usui Shiki Ryoho Energy Healer, ex-dancer, sunflower-seed addict, music lover, and internet child with a love for forests and any spin on ramen. As a self-proclaimed dragon slayer in the making, I'm always up for a challenge and eager to learn new things. I'm excited to bring my passion and problem-solving skills to any beautiful team or project.",

But, but thanks to my interdisciplinary experience and never-ending love for creation, here I am fueled with passion for that tasty and satisfying user experience. Although coding is like a never-ending quest, full of challenges, surprises, and the occasional episodes of madness, that's what makes it so exciting for me! I'm still at the beginning of my journey, but I'm already hooked. So, if you need a fearless adventurer with a passion for problem-solving and an insatiable appetite for ramen, I'm your person. Also if you need a human kaleidoscope of spirituality and internet memes here I am. Let's slay some dragons (respectively) and build something beautiful!",
